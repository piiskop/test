# R markdown

## Headings

Every chapter should have a first-level heading marked by `#`. A second-level heading has two of `#`, a third-level heading three of them and so on until six. Here's how to write a first-level heading followed by a second-level heading:

````markdown
# <first-level heading>

## <second-level heading>

````

The caption for references must be unnumbered so i did with the corresponding command:

````{verbatim label = "caption", language = "markdown"}
# References {.unnumbered}

````

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by two line-breaks:

````{verbatim label = "paragraph"}
<one paragraph>

<next paragraph>

````

## Italics

Text can be turned to italics using asterisks around it:

````markdown
*<text in italics>*

````

*\<text in italics\>*

## Color

```{verbatim label = "render-color", language = "r"}
render_color(color = "008000", text = "10 \\cdot V")

```

This text is `r render_color(color = "008000", text = "colored")`.

## Code

### As a block

Code blocks can be marked by three ticks following by braces containing metadata. The first metadata is the language. i've used so far `r` and `bash`:

````{verbatim label = "ssh-keygen", lang = "bash"}
```{bash eval = FALSE}
ssh-keygen

```

````

i keep an empty line at the end of the code block content because if i want to use a keyboard shortcut for commenting out it only works if the last line is empty.

If the language is `r render_nonmath_LaTeX_string_universal("\\LaTeX{}")` or `r render_nonmath_LaTeX_string_universal("\\LaTeX{}")` then the language must not only be in lowercase but have a preceding `=` `r render_with_emojis("((ref:riederer-611))")`:

````{verbatim, lang = "latex"}
```{=latex eval = FALSE}
\onecolumn

```

````

There are some options that can be used for code blocks or chunks in addition to them mentioned in the general [configuration](#knitr) part:

`eval`
: Shall the code be executed or not or what lines of the code should be executed?

If i want to show a code-block without rendering it, i use a `verbatim` block as a wrapper around it:

`````{verbatim label = "verbatim"}
````{verbatim label = "onecolumn-example", lang = "latex"}
```{=latex eval = FALSE}
\onecolumn

```

````

`````

For `verbatim` to work, it has to have at least one more backtick than the outermost inner block `r render_with_emojis("((ref:riederer-56))")`.

### Inline

The inline code must be between ticks:

````{verbatim label = "inline-code", lang = "markdown"}
i show how to display `<inline code>`.

````

i show how to display `<inline code>`.

## Quoting

For quoting, i use `>` at the beginning of each line of the quote.

````{verbatim label = "single-line-quote"}
> <the quoted text>

````

> \<the quoted text\>

It's also possible to do a multi-line quote by adding two spaces at the end of each line which means a line break `r render_with_emojis("((ref:markdown))")`:

```{verbatim label = "multi-line-quote", language = "markdown"}
> <first line of the quote>  
<second line of the quote>

```

> \<first line of the quote>  
\<second line of the quote>

Another way of multiline quoting is to inclue `>` in front of each row:

```{verbatim label = "multi-line-quote-with-angular-brackets", language = "markdown"}
> <first line of the quote>  
<second line of the quote>
>
> <fourth line of the quote>

```

> \<first line of the quote>  
\<second line of the quote>
>
> \<fourth line of the quote>

A quote with the author:

```{verbatim label = "quote-with-author"}
> All on konstantne. Siis ma... Midagi läheb sealt läbi, aga siis peab mõtlema, mis, mis kurat sealt läbi läheb.

`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Tõnu Laas')`
```

> All on konstantne. Siis ma... Midagi läheb sealt läbi, aga siis peab mõtlema, mis, mis kurat sealt läbi läheb.

`r tufte::quote_footer('--- Tõnu Laas')`

## Escaping

If a character must be escaped then a backslash can be used right in front of it:

````markdown
*\**

````

*\**

The following characters must be escaped:

1. *\_*,

2. *\@*.

## Referencing

### Common reference

A target for a common reference:

````markdown
[]{#<label-for-target>}

````

A link for a common target:

````markdown
[<link text>](#<label-for-target>)

````

### External reference

For having an external reference, i put its *Bib`r render_nonmath_LaTeX_string_universal("\\TeX{}")`* block into *references.bib*. i seldom create it manually. Instead, i use the help of MyBib `r render_with_emojis(text = "((ref:MyBib))")` where i *Start a new project* for every project, *Add Citation*, *Download References* as *Bib`r render_nonmath_LaTeX_string_universal("\\TeX{}")`*, copy the lastly added reference from the downloaded file into *references.bib* so that the items there are listed alphabetically. Another such helper is BibGuru `r render_with_emojis(text = "((ref:noauthor-nodate-tf))")`.

As there's a problem to display emojis and they appear seldom then i only use the emoji-able font *Symbola* that can't italics nor bold only for strings that contain emojis. External references can contain them. This is why all the external references will be rendered using *Symbola*. For that, i created a function called `render_with_emojis` that can't handle references directly but over inner reference because of the corresponding *bookdown* restriction. Therefore, for every record in the list of external references, i also create an inner reference into the end of the file *references.Rmd* like this:

```{verbatim label = "example-of-inner-reference-for-external-reference"}
(ref:<identifier-of-inner-reference-in-snake-case>) @<identifier-of-external-reference-as-is>

```

The identifier of the inner reference isn't allowed to contain underscores. Between every inner reference, at least one empty line must be.

For inline referencing, wherever i want to have a reference to that reference record i call `render_with_emojis` and feed it with a value for `text` as the identifier of the internal reference in parenthesis if the reference is direct and in double parenthesis if indirect:

````{verbatim label = "external-reference"}
i use MyBib `r render_with_emojis("((ref:<identifier-of-inner-reference-in-snake-case>))")`.

`r render_with_emojis("(ref:<identifier-of-inner-reference-in-snake-case>)")` automates creating references.

````

## Figures

For figures, i created a wrapper function `include_external_graphics()` for `knitr`'s `include_graphics()` because natively, `include_graphics()` doesn't support all the necessary file types: 

````{verbatim label = "including-external-graphics"}
```{r label = "<label of figure>", fig.cap = "<caption of figure>"}
include_external_graphics("<path-to-image-file>")

```

````

For this code chunk, i use the label and the following options:

label
: the label that can be referenced must not include underscores but can include dashes

fig.cap
: the caption of the figure. This must be present in order to reference it.

Other options are possible:

fig.align
: i set it to have the value `center` if i want the image to reside in center

fig.fullheight
: i set it to `TRUE` if the image would be printed out smaller otherwise

out.width
: the width. Sometimes, the image is too wide for the page. Here, i set the width to be .92 of the height of the text part on the page as that image is rotated at a right angle: `.92\\textheight`

out.height
: sometimes, especially images with full size tend to be still a bit too large, so i set this parameter to have a value like `96%`

out.extra:
: for instance to turn the image with `angle` that has a value in degrees


Referencing a figure takes place using `\@ref(fig:<label of figure>)`.

As an example, i refer to the figure \@ref(fig:workflow-example-reference-to-figure).

```{r label = "workflow-example-reference-to-figure", fig.cap = "The workflow from the written markdown to the ready output using *bookdown*."}
include_external_graphics("rmd/workflow.png")

```

If i want to include an external reference inside the figure caption, i have to use the function `render_with_emojis` inside the caption:

````{verbatim}

```{r label = "workflow", fig.cap = paste("The workflow from the written markdown to the ready output using *bookdown*", render_with_emojis("((ref:riederer-21))"), ".", sep = "")}
include_external_graphics("rmd/workflow.png")

```

````

```{r label = "workflow-example-with-external-reference", fig.cap = paste("The workflow from the written markdown to the ready output using *bookdown*", render_with_emojis("((ref:riederer-21))"), ".", sep = "")}
include_external_graphics("rmd/workflow.png")

```

Here, the function `paste` comes handy. `paste` glues strings together that can be fed into that function. The last parameter is `sep` which can be used to set the separator between the strings. Currently, i told the function to use an empty string as a separator.

## Equations

Equations can be inserted in math mode, id est between double bug signs if in a block or single bug signes if inline:

```{verbatim label = "equation-block"}
$$\frac{t_\text{d}}{}$$

```

$$\frac{t_\text{d}}{}$$

```{verbatim label = "equation-inline", language = "markdown"}
The same equation inline: $\frac{t_\text{d}}{}$.

```

The same equation inline: $\frac{t_\text{d}}{}$.
